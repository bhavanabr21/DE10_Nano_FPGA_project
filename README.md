The application of DE10 Nano FPGA board for Prevention and Detection of wildfire is the main objective of this project.

Wildfires are a widespread recurring phenomenon, and their frequency is increasing in recent times.
Goal is to prevent the happening of the havoc by predicting it before happening and detecting if a fire is already happening using a monitoring system using DE10 Nano FPGA board.

The proposed approach has two parts:
1. The first part addresses the prevention of Wildfires before in hand by mapping the wildfire vulnerable points in region of consideration by collecting thier weather related data that could affect the occurance of wildifres and application of Machine learning techniques to predict the probability of wildfire occurance and map the high probable regions.
2. The second part uses DE10 Nano FPGA with required sensors is used for monitoring the fire prone zones to monitor these vulnerable regions for fire indication if occured.
